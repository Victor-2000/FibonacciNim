# Fibonacci Nim
# Rules of the game
Fibonacci Nim is a 2 player game in which each player take turns collecting coins (or tokens) from a finite number of heaps with a finite
size. Players can take up to the double of the maximum of tokens taken throughout the game by any player from only one chosen heap. Player
1 is allowed to take up to 2 tokens in the first move. The player who has no more tokens to take loses.
# Note
I added a feature that customizes the number of tokens and heaps. The default size and number of heaps are 9 and 3, respectively. To change these values, write 2 numbers (heap size and number of heaps) directly after the execution instruction on cmd (java FibonacciNim num1 num2). Please make sure to type in the numbers correctly since invalid inputs are ignored by default.
