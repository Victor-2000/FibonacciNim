# Fibonacci Nim
# Rules of the game:
Fibonacci Nim is a 2 player game in which each player should take turns collecting coins (or tokens) from a finite number of heaps with 
a finite size.Players are allowed to take up to the double of the maximum of token taken thoughout the game by any player from only one 
chosen heap. Player 1 is allowed to take up to 2 tokens in the first move. The player which remains without tokens to take looses.
# Note
I added a feature in which the number of tokens and heaps is customisable. The default values are 9 for the size of heaps and 3 
for the number of heaps. For changing these values you should write 2 numbers directly after the execution instruction on cmd 
(java FibonacciNim num1 num2) where the first number will be the size of heaps and the second will be the number of heaps. 
It also contains excemption handling so be careful because if you not type it right it will go by default and ignore the input.
